# Introduction
Used MUI core. MUI Core is a collection of React UI libraries for shipping new feature faster. 

# Getting Started with MUI 
Your application will need to install MUI core.

## Material UI
Material UI is available as an npm package.\
npm:npm install @mui/materi al @emotion/react @emotion/styled\
yarn: yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

## MUI Base
MUI Base is available as an npm package.\
npm: npm install @mui/base\
yarn: yarn add @mui/base\
Note: MUI Base is still in alpha. We are adding new components regularly and you're welcome to contribute!

## MUI System
MUI System is available as an npm package.\
npm: npm install @mui/system @emotion/react @emotion/styled\
yarn: yarn add @mui/system @emotion/react @emotion/styled\
Or if you want to use styled-components as a styling engine:\
npm: npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components\
yarn: yarn add @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components

## MUI Icons-material
This package provides the Google Material Icons converted to SvgIcon components.
npm : npm install @mui/icons-material\
yarn : yarn add @mui/icons-material\
These components use the MUI SvgIcon component to render the SVG path for each icon.\
If you are not already using MUI in your project, you can add it with:\
npm : npm install @mui/material\
yarn: yarn add @mui/material


# Getting Started with Create React App

Your application will need react installed.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
